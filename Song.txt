There goes my valentine again
Soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone
Oh my god, have I done it again?
There's a pulse and it's deafening
I can't help what I hear in my head
It's the switch that I flick (when he says)

Hand of blood
I don't wanna feel... my heart is breaking
Hand of blood
I don't wanna see... my life is burning
